## tips
  - type SIGUSR1 in vscode and right click goto definition you can see all the signals that is defined and integer value of each signal.
```
#define SIGHUP  1       /* hangup */
#define SIGINT  2       /* interrupt */
#define SIGQUIT 3       /* quit */
#define SIGILL  4       /* illegal instruction (not reset when caught) */
#define SIGABRT 6       /* abort() */
#define SIGFPE  8       /* floating point exception */
#define SIGKILL 9       /* kill (cannot be caught or ignored) */
#define SIGSEGV 11      /* segmentation violation */
#define SIGSYS  12      /* bad argument to system call */
#define SIGPIPE 13      /* write on a pipe with no one to read it */
#define SIGALRM 14      /* alarm clock */
#define SIGTERM 15      /* software termination signal from kill */
#define SIGXCPU 24      /* exceeded CPU time limit */
#define SIGXFSZ 25      /* exceeded file size limit */
#define SIGVTALRM 26    /* virtual time alarm */
#define SIGINFO 29      /* information request */
#define SIGUSR1 30      /* user defined signal 1 */
#define SIGUSR2 31      /* user defined signal 2 */

## signal
  - As a pre requisite first we will learn about what is fork system call and wait system call.
    - fork system call : fork(),  Fork system call is used for creating a new process, which is called child process, which runs concurrently with the process that makes the fork() call (parent process). It takes no parameters and returns an integer value. Below are different values returned by fork(). for more details : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fork-system-call/
      - Negative Value: creation of a child process was unsuccessful.
      - Zero: Returned to the newly created child process.
      - Positive value: Returned to parent or caller. The value contains process ID of newly created child process.
    - wait system call : wait(), A call to wait() blocks the calling process until one of its child processes exits or a signal is received. After child process terminates, parent continues its execution after wait system call instruction. For more details : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wait-system-call-c/
 - A signal is a software generated interrupt that is sent to a process by the OS because of when user press ctrl-c or another process tell something to this process. There are fix set of signals that can be sent to a process. signal are identified by integers. Signal number have symbolic names. For example: 
 - The signal() function does not block other signals when the current handler’s execution is under process. At the same time, the sigaction function can block other signals until the current handler has returned.
	```
	  #define SIGHUP  1   /* Hangup the process */ 
	  #define SIGINT  2   /* Interrupt the process */ 
	  #define SIGQUIT 3   /* Quit the process */ 
	  #define SIGILL  4   /* Illegal instruction. */ 
	  #define SIGTRAP 5   /* Trace trap. */ 
	  #define SIGABRT 6   /* Abort. */
	```
  - For each process, the operating system maintains 2 integers with the bits corresponding to a signal numbers.
  - The two integers keep track of: pending signals and blocked signals 
  - With 32 bit integers, up to 32 different signals can be represented.
  - Sending signals via kill() : 
	```
	int kill(pid_t pid, int signal);
	pid: id of destination process
	signal: the type of signal to send
	Return value: 0 if signal was sent successfully
	```
  - let's look at how signal is implemented.
	```
	// allows for a signal to be caught, to be ignored, or to generate an interrupt
	sig_t signal(int sig, sig_t handler) {

	    // Construct the new disposition
	    struct sigaction newDisp;
	    newDisp.sa_handler = handler;
	    sigemptyset(&newDisp.sa_mask);
	    newDisp.sa_flags = SA_RESTART;

	    // We'll put the old disposition here
	    struct sigaction prevDisp;

	    if (sigaction(sig, &newDisp, &prevDisp) == -1) {
	      return SIG_ERR;
	    } else {
	      // User of signal doesn't care about the whole disposition; just the handler
	      return prevDisp.sa_handler;
	    }
	}
	```

## sigaction()
  - The “signal facility is a simplified interface to the more general sigaction facility.” Indeed, when we trace a C program with signal calls, we only see calls to sigaction system calls. We’re also told that “signal is less portable than sigaction when establishing a signal handler”.
  - Let’s look into sigaction. It’s a system call. It has a more complicated interface than signal:
	```
	#include <signal.h>
	int sigaction(int sig, const struct sigaction *restrict act, struct sigaction *restrict oact);
	```
  - sigaction(sig, act, oact) means “set the disposition for sig to act, and store the old disposition in oact”. Its return value is 0 or -1, indicating whether the system call errored.
  - Those struct sigactions are “dispositions”, meaning they express what to do when the given signal is received. The disposition consists of a handler, a mask, and some flags:
	```
	struct sigaction {
	 union __sigaction_u __sigaction_u;  /* signal handler */
	 sigset_t sa_mask;               /* signal mask to apply */
	 int     sa_flags;               /* see signal options below */
	};
	```
- The “mask” is a sigset_t, which is a set of signal numbers. The mask for signal sig expresses which signals the process can receive while it is handling signal number sig.
## sigemptyset()
  - Initializes a signal set set to the empty set. All recognized signals are excluded. 
  - sigemptyset() is part of a family of functions that manipulate signal sets. Signal sets are data objects that let a process keep track of groups of signals. For example, a process can create one signal set to record which signals it is blocking, and another signal set to record which signals are pending. 
  - Signal sets are used to manipulate groups of signals used by other functions (such as sigprocmask()) or to examine signal sets returned by other functions (such as sigpending()).
  - If successful, sigemptyset() returns 0.
		```
		#define _POSIX_SOURCE
		#include <signal.h>
		int sigemptyset(sigset_t *set);
		```
		```
		typedef struct __siginfo {
			int     si_signo;               /* signal number */
			int     si_errno;               /* errno association */
			int     si_code;                /* signal code */
			pid_t   si_pid;                 /* sending process */
			uid_t   si_uid;                 /* sender's ruid */
			int     si_status;              /* exit value */
			void    *si_addr;               /* faulting instruction */
			union sigval si_value;          /* signal value */
			long    si_band;                /* band event for SIGPOLL */
			unsigned long   __pad[7];       /* Reserved for Future Use */
		} siginfo_t;
		```
## exit()
  - Exit() is a core function in the C/C++ programming language that is used to instantly end the calling process (function). It is possible to call from any function. It informs the operating system of the state of program termination by passing an int value. It is usually used when software crashes unexpectedly. It is also recognized as the program’s current state. The exit function can be used to end a program at any moment, regardless of how many function calls have been performed. It calls a variety of other functions before terminating the application, such as shutting open files, to clean up. The exit function is specified in the < stdlib.h > header and is included in the C standard libraries.
  - The following example shows the usage of exit() function.
  ```
  	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <stdlib.h>

	int main () {
	   printf("Start of the program....\n");

	   printf("Exiting the program....\n");
	   exit(0);

	   printf("End of the program....\n");

	   return(0);
	}
  ```
  ```
  output:
  	Start of the program....
	Exiting the program....
  ```
